## Data analytics & Epidemiology
- Data analysis is vital for epidemiological research.
- Due to increasing discovery of new diseases, and pandemics, advancement for epidemiological studies is obligatory!
- The cost of commercial staistical softwares proves to be substantially high, as a result, developing countries often tend to rely on pirated software copies. (Majority of them consist of limited specifications)

## What is "R",and how could it be utilized?
- R is an open source programming language utilized for the study of data analysis and programming.
- It follows an “open source software philosophy”. 
- Makes upto some of the downsides of the commercial statistical package software!
- Vital tool for: Research epidemiologists, Mathematicians, Statisticians, and Public health analysts
- R is used to explore, analyze and interpret epidemiological data (Reports, Articles and tables)
- Capable of quantitatively expressing, graphically exploring, and describing epidemiologic data.
- R could be utilized as the following tools:

## R could be utilized as (1):
Full Function Calculator

## R and it's utilization
- R is able to manipulate, explore, and graphically display data with ease.
- Through the use of R: Epidemiologists are capable of handling several datasets could be simultaneously!
- Steep learning curve: Could produce descriptive graphs, and be used to view the trend of the pandemic/epidemics over time, and to predict future trends
- R offers a range of statistical tools (Readily integrated):

## 1)Cox proportional hazard regression

## The "r number" as an indicator
- Data (age,race,ethnicity, gender) is critical!
- Effects of the virus are understood by determining: 
1) r NUMBER (Reproduction Number), 
2) Number of cases, 
3) Severity
- r is the number one infected person who will pass the disease on to others
- The Corona crisis, is a global pandemic, and Governments are struggling to bring the number down (3-1)
- Currently with limited vaccinations made available to the public Covid-19’s r number is 2.5-3 (1.3 for the common flu)
- <1= Malicious outbreak`

## What does the spread look like?

!["The r number"](C:\Users\user\OneDrive\Desktop\r_border.jpg){width=100%}

## Human behaviour, and policy making in line with "r number"
- r number vary in line with human behaviour (quarantine, social distancing, hygiene etc.)
- r numbers play a crucial role in socio-economic state decision making (Impose lockdown, extend lockdown, ease lockdown, obligatory mask rule, maximum number of people allowed at a hotspot etc)
- E.g. When the lockdown was announced in march, the r number plunged to 0.6, exponentially decreasing the spread of the virus.
- Why are we currently in a lockdown: The r numbers are exponentially higher than 1
- What can we do: Have patience, responsibility, and most importantly wear our masks!

## How is the "R number" extracted
- E.g. with a mean of 5.0 days, and a standard deviation of 3.4 for the serial interval distribution would result in a r number of 2.503. 
- Keeping in mind that any number higher than 1 is lethal, the 2.503 scale is extremely volatile and highly contagious!

## Drawbacks of the "r number"
- The r number is one of the indicators to analyze the degree of outbreak

- It doesn't provide real time data (Lacks real time updates)

- Represents only an average across a region (E.g. Bonn & Cologne might have different r numbers, but they are categorized under the state of “North Rhine Westphalia, and are given the same r number)

## What is RECON?
- Known as “R Epidemics Consortium”, is an international non profit & non governmental organization.
- They gather experts in fields such as; data science, modeling methodology, public health, and software development to create the next generation of analytics tools.
- They are specialized in analyzing and informing the mass about how to act in line with the outbreak (Aid in contingency)
- Most fundamentally used RECON tool: "R"

## RECON's Packages
- RECON’s packages are specifically designed for:
- Handling
- Visualising
- Analysing outbreak data 
- Using cutting-edge statistical methods, fulfilling three key aspects:
1) Efficiency-Real time information in order to improve awareness
2) Reliability-Tested and approved through professional software development methods
3) Accessibility-Openly sourced accessible tools, made available on virtually any platform.

## RECON Learn (One of RECON'S packages)
![https://www.repidemicsconsortium.org/](C:\Users\user\OneDrive\Desktop\download.png){width=100%}

## RECON learn
- This package gives a few insights on the methodological aspects of sorrounding the outbreak
- E.g. Days/Weeks index, availability of limited data, limited intervention, rate of response.
- The data that's available is extracted from past learnings (Previous outbreaks)
- E.g. Dates of death or recovery, Dates of exposure, contact tracing (who infects who), and dates of symptoms.
![](C:\Users\user\Downloads\WhatsApp Image 2020-12-18 at 8.21.40 PM (2).jpeg){width=40%}

## Factors to consider when analyzing the outbreak:
- Rate of growth
- Reason 
- Fatality ratio
- Degree of effect on the pupil

![](C:\Users\user\Downloads\WhatsApp Image 2020-12-18 at 8.21.40 PM (5).jpeg){width=60%}

## Predictions??
- Another major challenge for the data scientists of RECON is to forecast the expected number of cases within a certain time frame.

![](C:\Users\user\Downloads\WhatsApp Image 2020-12-18 at 8.21.40 PM (4).jpeg){width=80%}

## Other factors?
- Population
- Samples (Cases of covid reported within a certain period)
- Statistics regarding the degree of fatalities
- Inference (E.g. Bavaria has the highest R number in Germany)

## Estimating Key Delays 1
- Incubation Period: Refers to the time interval between the date on infection and the date of symptom onset!
![](C:\Users\user\OneDrive\Desktop\Ic.JPG){width=65%}

## Estimating Key Delays 2
- The serial interval : Refers to the time interval between onset of symptoms in primary, and secondary cases.

![](C:\Users\user\OneDrive\Desktop\ic 2.JPG){width=70%}

## Estimating Key Delays 3
- The Generation Time : Refers to the time travel interval between date of infections in primary, and secondary cases.

## Web Scraping
- COVID data isn't written in a straightforward manner, but given rather in counts (Embedded)
- E.g. Recovered cases, deaths count, magnitude of affected people at a certain hotspot
- Web Scraping: Is a technique used to extract a large magnitude of data from the website and store it in a local desktop in a table or spreadsheet format.
- Data used from sources such as wikipedia (Easy to read) are often challenging to scrape, since they're crowdsourced, and lack real time updates 

## John Hopkins University Center
- Home to several notoriously known collection of coallted data, which provide real time information, centering the pandemic.
- ALL TECHNOLOGY HAS CONSTRAINTS: Datasets from John Hopkins university consists of few missing data (Lagging time, few missing incidents)

## The Second Wave

!["The Comeback"](C:\Users\user\OneDrive\Desktop\Capture.JPG){width=80%}

## Germany's haunted State 
- Why is it important to have a detailed analysis of primary & secondary cases?
- Why has Saxony been affected so hard by the "Second Wave"

![](C:\Users\user\OneDrive\Desktop\europakarte.jpg){width=70%}

## "Saxonian second wave"
- The East German state of Saxony is one of the worst hit regions by the second wave.
- Hospitals are in deep turmoil, due to limited bed capacities (It has to choose who gets access over the ventilators.
- Currently, Saxony is under a complete lockdown, just as other German states.

![](C:\Users\user\OneDrive\Desktop\ec46393fedb9f4ad1001eb78df738d0f62cf58bdc3117f36589dea403e694fd1.jpg){width=50%}

## Saxony is the worst hit with 40.4% (with cases there now at over 400 per 100,000 inhabitants)

![](C:\Users\user\OneDrive\Desktop\saxony.JPG){width=80%}

## The Reason? Unknown!!
- Why is the reason unknown? Since data on where people have contracted the virus is still unknown. 
- It’s vital have an insight of the primary cases, secondary cases, and location of contraction in order to have a 360 degree analysis on the outbreak, and to stabilize)
- However, Epidemiologists have constructed some "theories" regarding the rapid outbreak:

![](C:\Users\user\OneDrive\Desktop\npc.jpg){width=60%}

## Theory 1 (An aging population)
- The state has the oldest population in Germany, who are more likely to contract the virus, and infect one another in comparison to the youth.

![](C:\Users\user\OneDrive\Desktop\3t5cfd.jpg){width=40%}

## Theory 2 (Borders with Czech Republic & Poland)
- Saxony shares its border with the Czech Republic and Poland, thus making it accessible for them to travel to and from the state, with no obligatory testing required. 
- Just like Saxony, the Central European country of Czech Republic has been hit hard by the second wave, since dropping the majority of it’s Corona restrictions in the summer.
- The cases in Czech Republic are progressing to increase.
- On the other hand, Poland has also seen similar circumstances, fortunately, the cases are falling in Poland under the current circumstances.

## Theory 3 (Hotspots in Villages)
- The two of the major Saxonian cities (Dresden & Leipzig), haven’t been hit as hard as the rural areas and the countryside.
- Some epidemiologists claim that the reason for this is “carelessness” (Meeting friends, holding private gatherings at remote locations where authorities hold hardly any control.)
